# Release checklist

Tracks what is genuinely ready to ship and what is still open. Update it as things land; the value
is in it being honest, not in it being all ticked.

## Build and pipeline

- [x] Assembly definitions split (`SolarMajesty.Systems` / `.Runtime` / `.Editor` / `.Tests.EditMode`)
- [x] Automated EditMode tests (129 passing)
- [x] CI on push and nightly ([.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml))
- [x] Headless build command ([BuildCommands.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Editor/BuildCommands.cs))
- [x] Standalone player builds (macOS verified)
- [x] Bundle identifier set (`com.solarmajesty.solarmajesty`)
- [ ] Application icons for every platform size
- [ ] Code signing and notarisation (macOS), Authenticode (Windows)
- [ ] `UNITY_LICENSE` / `UNITY_EMAIL` / `UNITY_PASSWORD` secrets added to the GitHub repo so CI can run

## Systems

- [x] Fixed 20 Hz simulation tick ([SimClock.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/SimClock.cs))
- [x] Game speed: hold, 1x, 2x, 3x ([SimSpeed.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/SimSpeed.cs))
- [x] Versioned full-world save with atomic writes ([SaveSystem.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/SaveSystem.cs))
- [x] Save covers flags, escrow, robot health and purse, fauna — the gaps the old continue slot had
- [ ] Restore of live robots and fauna positions (captured in the file, not yet re-placed on load)
- [x] Alert feed with dedupe, severity, and jump-to ([AlertFeed.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/AlertFeed.cs))
- [x] Run statistics and end-of-run verdict ([RunStats.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/RunStats.cs))
- [x] Achievements, persisted ([Achievements.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/Achievements.cs))
- [x] Named robots with service records ([SpecialistIdentity.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/SpecialistIdentity.cs))
- [ ] Hardcoded catalogs moved to ScriptableObject databases (`TechCatalog`, `ShopCatalog`, `CelestialBodyCatalog`)
- [ ] Ironman wired to the run configuration (the achievement hook exists, the mode toggle does not)

## Look

- [x] ACES tonemapping and per-body white balance
- [x] SSAO and decal renderer features enabled
- [x] `PostProcessData` assigned — bloom and vignette were configured but never rendering
- [x] Exponential fog replacing the linear fog that washed the campus one colour
- [x] `SM_Hull` procedural panel/wear/dust shader
- [x] `SM_PlanetGround` slope-aware ground shader
- [x] Displaced terrain with level campus pads ([TerrainMeshBuilder.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/World/TerrainMeshBuilder.cs))
- [x] Scatter props share cached instanced materials instead of one material each
- [ ] Fresh Mars still captured as a spaced overseer campus (run **Solar Majesty > Render > Capture Mars Still** in the editor; batch mode cannot drive play mode). Do not score vs the retired VisualTarget PNG.
- [ ] Campus landmark pass: pad, Starship, solar, extractors readable when placed — empty dirt OK, not fill-every-patch
- [ ] LOD chains on the hero building meshes

## Motion

- [x] Velocity-driven locomotion: gait bob, lean, bank, squash ([UnitMotion.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Motion/UnitMotion.cs))
- [x] Two-bone IK legs for walkers and arthropod fauna ([ProceduralLegs.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Motion/ProceduralLegs.cs))
- [x] Tread scrolling on tracked classes
- [x] Camera shake on impacts, module loss, and construction
- [x] Edge scroll and mouse wheel zoom
- [ ] Scripted camera beat for launch and victory

## Audio

- [x] Channel buses with ducking ([SoundBus.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/SoundBus.cs))
- [x] Pooled 3D positional one-shots ([SpatialAudio.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Audio/SpatialAudio.cs))
- [x] Adaptive four-stem generative score ([AdaptiveMusic.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Audio/AdaptiveMusic.cs))
- [x] Synthesised Overseer voice and robot chirps ([OverseerVoice.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Audio/OverseerVoice.cs))
- [ ] Existing one-shots migrated from 2D `DemoAudio` to `SpatialAudio`
- [ ] Missing clips authored: `sfx_extract`, `sfx_build_complete`, `sfx_research` (currently fall through to synthesis)

## Interface

- [x] UI Toolkit foundation with a USS design system ([SolarMajesty.uss](../Assets/Resources/UI/SolarMajesty.uss))
- [x] Alert feed rendered in UI Toolkit ([OverseerAlertView.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/UI/OverseerAlertView.cs))
- [x] Procedural icon set ([UiIcons.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/UI/UiIcons.cs)), wired into the resource chips
- [x] Map overlays for power, threat, and defence coverage ([MapOverlay.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Runtime/UI/MapOverlay.cs))
- [ ] Remaining IMGUI panels migrated to UI Toolkit (`OverseerHud.cs` is still ~2,100 lines)
- [ ] Tooltips on every panel
- [ ] Controls screen generated from `InputBindings` (the binding system exists; the screen does not)

## Accessibility

- [x] Colourblind palettes: deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia ([Accessibility.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/Accessibility.cs))
- [x] Reduce motion (suppresses camera shake)
- [x] HUD scale
- [x] Severity carried by icon and text prefix as well as colour
- [x] Frame cap selector
- [x] Rebindable keys with conflict rejection ([InputBindings.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/InputBindings.cs))
- [ ] Runtime input routed through `InputBindings` (roughly 100 literal `KeyCode` sites remain)
- [ ] Gamepad support
- [ ] Independent UI text scaling

## Localization

- [x] Lookup with English fallback ([Localization.cs](../Assets/Scripts/Systems/Localization.cs))
- [ ] Strings extracted into a table (~2,360 literals still inline)
- [ ] Machine translation pass and community correction
- [ ] Font fallback for non-Latin scripts

## Before Early Access

- [ ] **The 45–90 minute external playtest** ([PLAYTEST_PROTOCOL.md](PLAYTEST_PROTOCOL.md)) — still the single
      largest open risk; nobody outside the project has played this
- [ ] 60 fps with 200 agents, profiled rather than assumed
- [ ] Full playthrough on all five bodies without an exception
- [ ] Steam page, capsule art, screenshots
- [ ] Trailer
- [ ] Demo build for a Next Fest
- [ ] Phase 4 exit review re-run against a fresh still
